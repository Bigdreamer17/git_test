                Beverage Store is a locally owned and operated coffee shop and
                caf√©, located in the heart of downtown. We have been serving the
                community for over 10 years and pride ourselves on providing
                high quality drinks and excellent customer service.

                Our team is made up of passionate coffee and tea lovers, who are
                dedicated to serving the best beverages possible. We source our
                beans and leaves from ethical and sustainable sources and take
                great care in brewing and preparing each cup. We also offer a
                selection of locally baked goods, sandwiches, and salads, which
                are made fresh daily.
